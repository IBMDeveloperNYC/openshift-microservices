# Deploying Java Microservices to OpenShift on IBM Cloud

This workshop demonstrates how to build a microservice with Java and how to deploy it to OpenShift on the IBM Cloud. It is an adaption of the workshop provided by [IBM Developer UK](https://github.com/nheidloff/openshift-on-ibm-cloud-workshops/tree/master/2-deploying-to-openshift#deploying-java-microservices-to-openshift-on-ibm-cloud)

The microservice is kept as simple as possible, so that it can be used as a starting point for other microservices. The microservice has been developed with Java EE and [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/).

There are [various ways to deploy applications to OpenShift](http://heidloff.net/article/deploying-open-liberty-microservices-openshift/). The options have different advantages and disadvantages which are explained in the following labs.
